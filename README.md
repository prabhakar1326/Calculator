How It Works
HTML defines the structure of the calculator.
The <div> elements are used to create the display screen and buttons.
CSS is used to style the calculator:
Buttons are styled with colors, sizes, and hover effects.
The layout is centered using Flexbox to ensure the calculator is always centered in the browser window.
JavaScript controls the functionality:
Each button has an event listener to handle its click.
Numbers are added to the display screen, and operators are used to perform calculations.
When "=" is clicked, the result of the operation is calculated and displayed.
The screen is cleared with the "C" button.
